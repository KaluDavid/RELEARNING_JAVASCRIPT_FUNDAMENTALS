 by using the special “fat arrow” () => notation.

Preview: Docs Arrow function expressions were introduced in ES6. These expressions are a clean and concise alternative to the traditional function syntax.


Arrow functions
 remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the function body surrounded in { } like this:

const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};


It’s important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing functions because you will come across each of these when reading other JavaScript code.
