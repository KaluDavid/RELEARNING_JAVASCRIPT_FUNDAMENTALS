NOTE: THIS CHALLENGE IS A STRICTLY PROMPTED CHALLENGE FROM CHATGPT

👉 Here's all about the challenge
Hey buddy! Since you're looking for a robust and challenging task on conditional statements, I've got a multi-level challenge for you. This task will test everything you've learned so far—comparison operators, logical operators, truthy/falsy values, the ternary operator, `switch`, and if-else statements.

 🛠 Challenge: "Smart ATM System"

You're building a basic ATM system that will:  
✅ Check user PIN before granting access  
✅ Allow the user to withdraw, deposit, or check balance  
✅ Prevent overdrawing and handle invalid inputs

---

 🔹 Requirements

1. User Authentication:

   - Ask for a 4-digit PIN (e.g., `1234`).
   - If correct, proceed; otherwise, deny access.

2. ATM Options:

   - Show a menu:
     ```
     1. Check Balance
     2. Withdraw Money
     3. Deposit Money
     4. Exit
     ```
   - Use `switch` or `if...else if` to handle user input.

3. Conditions to Check:

   - If checking balance, show the current balance.
   - If withdrawing, check if there’s enough money before allowing.
   - If depositing, only accept positive amounts.
   - If exiting, show a goodbye message.

4. Bonus Features (for extra challenge):
   - Use the ternary operator in at least one case.
   - Use logical operators to validate inputs (e.g., checking if the user enters a number).
   - Use truthy/falsy values to prevent empty inputs.
